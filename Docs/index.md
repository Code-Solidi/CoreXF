Welcome to CoreXF!

This is version 1.x of the CoreXF framework. The main goal of the framework is to help modularizing existing ASP.NET Core 2.x (or higher) applications as well as to assist in building new ones as extensible software pieces.

These are the main topics which, hopefully, will help in determining if it suits ones needs, how to get started with the framework, using it the best way, requesting new features, and reporting bugs.

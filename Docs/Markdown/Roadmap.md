Here's a simple list of what should be expected in future versions:
* Communication channel allowing for inter-extension communications (Message bus, Even bus)
* Runtime discovery of available extensions
* Running different versions of the same extension side by side
* Starting, pausing, stopping an extension
* And, of course, a lot of tests which are all missing now.
